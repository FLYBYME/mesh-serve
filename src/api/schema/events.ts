/**
 * What a site exposes as an event stream, and to whom.
 *
 * mesh-web spec/network.md §5.1, decided: **scoping an event is a different problem from scoping a
 * call**, and the previous implementation solved it in a way that failed open.
 *
 * A call is confined by a query filter — mesh's `beforeCrud` narrows the query using
 * `meta.user.tenant_id` before the database sees it, and one request has one caller and one scope.
 * An event has neither. It is emitted once to the whole mesh by whatever caused it, and arrives at
 * an instance holding connections for many users in many organizations. There is no query to filter,
 * and the payload of a CRUD event is `{ domain, id, item }` — nothing in it is *declared* to be a
 * scope.
 *
 * `archive/pre-rewrite` guessed: it searched the payload, one level of nesting, and packet meta for
 * any of `orgId`, `tenantId`, `tenant_id`, `organizationId` or `scope`, and then delivered the event
 * to **everyone** when the guess came back empty. An event declared `scope: 'org'` whose payload
 * named its organization field anything else went to every connected browser in every organization.
 *
 * So here the scope is **declared**, and an event whose declared scope cannot be read is delivered to
 * nobody.
