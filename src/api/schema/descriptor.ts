/**
 * The exposure descriptor: the site's exposure, as data.
 *
 * mesh-web roadmap C3.2 decided the site's repository is the source of truth for what it exposes and
 * the API's collection is a resolved cache. This file is what turns the site's `ExposeEntry[]` —
 * TypeScript, holding live zod schemas and imported at boot — into something a *build* can read:
 * plain JSON, no zod, no imports, no running cluster.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point. The generated browser client is produced from this
 * (mesh-web spec/network.md §4), so it must be derivable without starting anything. A generator that
 * needed a live API could not run in CI before the API was deployed, which is exactly when you want
 * to know the client is wrong.
 *
 * **Structural, not referential.** Input and output are emitted as JSON Schema rather than as a
 * reference to the zod object that produced them — mesh-web spec/network.md §3.1, and surfdns #15,
 * where a `z.infer` reaching across a package boundary broke on a version bump. A descriptor states
 * the shapes it means.
