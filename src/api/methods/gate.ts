/**
 * The gate: may this caller make this call, and in whose scope.
 *
 * mesh-web spec/kernel.md §4 — the API is the only security boundary in the system. Everything else
 * in this repository is plumbing; this file is the part that must be right.
 *
 * ## What changed from `archive/pre-rewrite`, and why
 *
 * The old `executeGate` read, in essence:
 *
 *     if (authorize) { ...delegate entirely... }
 *     else { checkAuth(entry.auth) }
 *
 * so supplying an `authorize` hook **replaced** the coarse gate instead of adding to it. surfdns
 * found this and wrote it down in its own source before anyone else did:
 *
 *   > "mesh-api's `executeGate` replaces `checkAuth` when an authorize hook is supplied, so a hook
 *   > that returns 'no objection from me' grants everything."
 *
 * A security boundary that can be switched off by returning `true` from the wrong place is not a
 * boundary. Here the coarse gate **always** runs, and the hook runs after it and **can only narrow**:
 * it may deny, and it may resolve a scope. It cannot admit anyone the gate refused.
